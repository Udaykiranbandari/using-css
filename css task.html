        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

            It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
            The main advantages are separation of content (in HTML) and styling (in CSS) and the same CSS rules can be used across all pages and not have to be rewritten.
            HTML uses tags and CSS uses rule sets.
            CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors.</p>

    <p>In web development, the CSS box model refers to how HTML elements are modeled in browser engines and how the dimensions of those HTML elements are derived from CSS properties. It is a fundamental concept for the composition of HTML webpages.[3] The guidelines of the box model are described by web standards World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifically the CSS Working Group. For much of the late-1990s and early 2000s there had been non-standard compliant implementations of the box model in mainstream browsers.</p>

        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
            CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
            External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
